# Feature Specification: Aggregate Operation (S07)

This feature reuses the canonical aggregate specification.

- Canonical spec: `../001-aggregate-operation/spec.md`
- Canonical contracts: `../001-aggregate-operation/contracts/`
- Canonical quickstart: `../001-aggregate-operation/quickstart.md`

This file exists so S07 reviews and automation have a stable spec path at
`specs/008-aggregate-operation/spec.md`.
