I want to develop this process focusing on the specs and not the implementation details. I would like to, once the specs are finalized, have a set of agents move the development process forward without my involvement.
Only ask questions that stop the process if there are critical inconsistencies in the spec.

I would like for the agents to develop several of the features in parallel, guided by the [[implementation-plan#^d36dec|Parallelism Plan]]. 

I need you to guide me through the selection of AI tools (Claude, Warp, Copilot) and agent orchestration.
I also want to establish a dev environment where parallel development using headless agents and speckit (which requires a branch per feature) are possible (devcontainers, perhaps?)
